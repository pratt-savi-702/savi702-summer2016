My final project focused on food and food access in Brooklyn, the borough of New York that is in the news almost daily due to discussions around gentrification. I’ve been thinking about income disparities, as well as the acknowledgement of New York City as a whole as a “food desert.” I believe that food access is an important issue, and the city is taking steps to make food more accessible to those in all income brackets. For instance, most farmers markets in the city take SNAP or another form of payment called Health Bucks. Still, obesity rates have remained the same.

So for this project, I played around with data I found around locations of Farmers Markets and CSAs, etc, and looked at the data in relation to population data.
